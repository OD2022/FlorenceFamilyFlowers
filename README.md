About Florence’s Family Flowers

Plants are very important to society, as they provide oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, supply 
nutrients to the soil and serve as food for other creatures. Flowers, in tandem with bees, are 
responsible for pollination, making plants and flowers the base of the food chain.
Flowers have been known for centuries to provide scents and decoration to humans' lives and 
have a positive psychological impact on many people. Flowers are used as gifts, wedding 
ornaments, funeral placements, party decorations, etc. Plants have different life cycles that 
determine when they grow, appropriate climates, and maximum height attainable. Flowers 
always have a life expectancy(shelf life) outside of its host plant.
Florence's Family Flowers is an environmentally conscious company in Ghana dedicated to 
caring for and selling plants, flowers, and seeds. Our mission is to reach as many people as 
possible and restore a love for nature in them, regardless of biases associated with race or 
marital status. Our target customer list is extensive, as both the young and old, male or female, 
should partake in the etiquette of flower gifting and the environmental duty of botany. 
However, we know that females, above middle-income persons, couples, environmentalists 
and companies are our most frequent customers.
We do nationwide deliveries and deliver all our products in eco-friendly electric vehicles 
designed to properly cool and preserve our products. We have in-house drivers that drive our 
vehicles. In the future, we want to ensure that the products we purchase are also delivered in 
an environmentally friendly manner. We currently outsource from farms and have our farms, 
which produce a range of organic and safe inorganic plants. Some of our employees are 
horticulturalists who manage our farms.
Our company provides readymade flower arrangements for events, including our plants and 
flowers. An in-house designer typically oversees these events. Our arrangements are, however, 
available only in theory to avoid the wastage of resources. Arrangements are pieced together 
after payment. Florists usually piece together arrangements, dust the shop or engage with 
customers. 
The company is non-departmental, as we believe in a flat non-hierarchical structure to promote 
equity and socialism. We have a managerial position that is rotated yearly, and it is the 
managers duty to order new products from the external farms.
